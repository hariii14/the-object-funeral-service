# The Object Funeral Service

Build a polished, highly interactive web app called “The Object Funeral Service” — a completely useless but hilarious social platform where people photograph ordinary objects and create dramatic memorials/funerals for them.

The concept:
People can take a photo of any object using their phone/laptop camera or upload an image. The app turns that object into a ridiculously serious memorial card. Other users can browse the memorials in a Pinterest-style feed, leave candle tributes, and view the object's “life story.”

The entire experience should feel like a combination of:

an old newspaper archive

a handwritten funeral/memorial book

Pinterest

a slightly absurd museum

minimalist editorial design

The humor should come from treating completely ordinary objects as if they were deeply important historical figures.

VISUAL STYLE

Use a minimalistic paper-and-ink aesthetic.

Color palette:

warm off-white / aged paper background

black/dark charcoal ink

subtle gray

very occasional muted red only for important actions

Avoid:

gradients

neon colors

glossy cards

generic SaaS aesthetics

excessive rounded corners

modern dashboard appearance

Use typography that looks handwritten and editorial:

handwritten-style display font for object names/headlines

clean serif/sans-serif for supporting information

subtle typewriter-style elements where appropriate

The interface should look slightly imperfect and tactile:

subtle paper grain

tiny ink imperfections

slightly rotated cards

hand-drawn divider lines

dashed borders

handwritten annotations

imperfect circles around important elements

Keep it elegant and minimal rather than making it visually noisy.

HOMEPAGE

Create a beautiful landing/feed page.

Top navigation:

Left:
THE OBJECT FUNERAL SERVICE™

Center/right:

Memorials

Recently Departed

Most Mourned

Right:
+ Memorialize an Object

Hero section:

Large handwritten headline:

“Gone, but unnecessary.”

Subtitle:

“A quiet place to remember objects that once meant absolutely nothing to anyone.”

Below it, a small hand-drawn line.

Then a search bar:

“Search the deceased…”

The main content should be a Pinterest-style masonry grid.

Do NOT use a standard equal-height card grid.

Cards should have different image heights and tiny random rotations, like physical photographs/paper cards scattered on a table.

MEMORIAL CARDS

Each memorial card should contain:

object photograph

object name

birth/death years if provided

short obituary

cause of death

candle/tribute count

heart/tribute button

Example:

USB Cable

2017 — 2026

“Connected to everyone. Worked with nobody.”

Cause of death:
Chronic connectivity failure.

🕯 84

Cards should have slightly different rotations.

Hovering over a card should:

straighten the card

slightly lift it

reveal subtle details

produce a tiny paper/ink interaction

Do not make the animation excessive.

CREATE MEMORIAL FLOW

When the user clicks “+ Memorialize an Object”, open a beautiful modal or dedicated page.

Title:

“Let us remember them.”

Provide two options:

OPTION 1 — LIVE CAMERA

Ask for camera permission and display the webcam feed.

Large button:

TAKE PHOTOGRAPH

When clicked:

capture the current camera frame

show the captured image

allow retake

allow confirmation

Support mobile cameras using the appropriate browser camera APIs.

OPTION 2 — UPLOAD

Allow the user to upload an image from their device.

Show a beautiful drag-and-drop paper area:

“Place the photograph here.”

Also provide a normal file picker.

After image selection, show a preview.

MEMORIAL FORM

After the image is selected, ask:

Object's name
Placeholder:
“Old USB Cable”

Cause of death
Placeholder:
“Stopped working at the worst possible moment.”

Its final story
Placeholder:
“Write something unnecessarily emotional…”

Born
Placeholder:
“2019”

Departed
Placeholder:
“2026”

Add an optional checkbox:

☐ Let the AI write the obituary

If enabled, generate a short, absurdly dramatic obituary based on the object name, cause and story.

Example:

Object:
USB Cable

Generated obituary:

“It spent six years searching for the correct orientation. It never found it.”

Keep generated text humorous and short.

Final button:

🕯 CREATE MEMORIAL

Button should have a subtle ink-stamp animation when clicked.

MEMORIAL CREATION ANIMATION

When the user creates a memorial:

Do NOT instantly redirect.

Show a short theatrical animation.

The photograph appears like a physical photograph being placed onto paper.

Then:

“Preparing the memorial…”

A small hand-drawn candle appears.

Then:

“They will be remembered.”

Then transition into the newly created memorial card.

Keep the animation around 1–2 seconds.

MEMORIAL DETAIL PAGE

Clicking a memorial should open a detailed memorial page.

Large photograph on the left.

Information on the right:

OBJECT NAME

Born:
2019

Departed:
2026

Cause:
Chronic connectivity failure.

Then the obituary in handwritten typography.

Below:

LEAVE A TRIBUTE

Allow visitors to light a virtual candle.

Button:

🕯 Light a candle

Every click increments the candle count.

Add tiny candle animations when clicked.

Display:

“84 people have remembered this object.”

Also include a simple comment/tribute section where users can write short messages.

Examples:

“Gone too soon.”

“Never worked when I needed it.”

“F.”

“Thank you for your service.”

PINTEREST-LIKE DISCOVERY

Create multiple sections:

Recently Departed

Newest memorials.

Most Mourned

Objects with the highest candle counts.

Forgotten Souls

Memorials with almost no interactions.

Questionable Deaths

Objects with ridiculous causes of death.

Examples:

“Lost during a house move”

“Destroyed by younger sibling”

“Dropped exactly once”

“Cable developed trust issues”

“Unknown circumstances”

“Was replaced despite functioning perfectly”

Use the masonry layout throughout.

SEARCH

The search bar should actually filter memorials.

Search by:

object name

cause of death

obituary

category

Example searches:

“chair”
“broken”
“USB”
“lost”

Show a small handwritten empty state when there are no results:

“No deceased objects found.”

Then:

“Perhaps they are still alive.”

CATEGORY SYSTEM

Allow memorials to have optional categories:

Electronics

Stationery

Clothing

Furniture

Toys

Household

Miscellaneous

Add a subtle category filter near the search bar.

FUN FEATURES

Add small useless statistics to memorial pages:

OBJECT STATISTICS

Years served: 6

Known owners: 1

Major incidents: 14

Successful repairs: 0

Last known location:
“Somewhere in the house.”

Historical importance:
Questionable

These statistics should be humorous rather than actually useful.

“OBJECT OF THE DAY”

On the homepage, feature one memorial as:

OBJECT OF THE DAY

Large photograph.

Example:

THE LEFT SOCK

2018 — 2026

“Separated from its partner under mysterious circumstances.”

Add:

Remembered by 231 people

Make this section visually resemble a newspaper front page.

LIVE ACTIVITY

Add a tiny “live memorial activity” section.

Examples:

🕯 Someone just remembered The Old Calculator

🕯 3 people are mourning USB Cable #42

🕯 Chair #17 received a tribute

This should feel like an unnecessarily serious breaking-news ticker.

Use mock data initially.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN

The website must work beautifully on:

mobile

tablet

desktop

On mobile:

2-column Pinterest masonry where possible

sticky bottom/create button if useful

camera interface should use the full available screen

cards should remain easy to tap

On desktop:

3–5 column masonry depending on viewport width

spacious editorial layout

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Use:

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

modern component architecture

browser MediaDevices API for webcam capture

local image preview

localStorage for the initial prototype

Structure the application cleanly so a backend can be connected later.

Create reusable components for:

MemorialCard

MasonryFeed

CameraCapture

ImageUploader

MemorialForm

MemorialDetail

CandleButton

SearchBar

CategoryFilter

ActivityTicker

ObjectOfTheDay

Use realistic mock memorial data on first launch so the website immediately looks populated.

Persist newly created memorials locally so refreshing the page does not immediately remove them.

IMPORTANT DESIGN PRINCIPLE

This should NOT look like a generic AI startup.

It should feel like someone built an extremely serious institution for a completely ridiculous purpose.

The joke should come from the contrast between:

extremely polished design + extremely unnecessary purpose.

Every interaction should feel unnecessarily ceremonial.

Use subtle animations, paper textures, handwritten annotations and tiny details to make the experience memorable.

The final result should feel like a project people at a hackathon/event would want to walk up to, photograph an object, memorialize it, and then show their friends.

The app's personality is:

“We take useless things extremely seriously.”
